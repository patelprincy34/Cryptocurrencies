# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies 
### Overview
The purpose of this analysis  is to use unsupervised machine learning to  evaluate  datasets from a variety of alternative cryptocurrencies in order to identify trends that would lead a company or individual to invest in them.

### Results
Here is the Elbow curve for Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-Means
* The best k value seems to be 4, so in order to categorize the crytocurrenciesan we would need output of 4 clusters
